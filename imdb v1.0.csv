At a secret meeting the families' obscure Organisation orders a fixer, Victor, to destabilize the country, to create a climate of fear in which the ordinary citizen would not only accept bud gladly welcome harsh repression. A few random killings on innocent bystanders in staged hold-ups, however, do not provoke the desired terror. With the help of Phil, a cold Dutroux-like sociopath, Victor is successful. While Phil focuses on kidnappings, rape and gruesome murders with his sidekick Jack, Victor uses blackmail and corruption to silence political leaders, captains, of industry, magistrates, even the clergy. Their joined efforts soon instigate the coveted widespread fear and insecurity. The Organisation is happy : much more law-and-order, much less freedom and democracy...,","BEF 10,000,000(estimated)",,,Flemish Film Productions,,,,,,Blue Belgium: The Dutroux Connection,,,,

This story touches a universal chord as it explores the passing on of an artistic legacy in spite of the dark shadows of an unresolved past.","The Stonecutter is a present day drama about a man reclaiming his strength and creativity after years of denial and self-destructive anger. Ray Rucci, age 29, was once a gifted stonecutter who apprenticed with one of the masters, his father. At age 17, Ray found out about a dark family secret and his world fell apart. He ran away, in part to protect his sister by keeping this secret from her, and from a revered father now reviled. At war abroad in the Special Forces, then the years adrift, the trouble with the law - Ray remains a heart-hardened man at war with himself. The film opens as he intervenes a street fight, taking a man's life. That same evening he presents a necklace he's hand crafted to the woman who's trying to get him to open his heart and he gets a long-distance phone call from a step-mother he didn't know he had: his father is dying.

What separates Denver from the others is her willingness to kill to get what she wants. When Denver decides to make a lurid documentary about Hollywood prostitutes, she runs into a major obstacle - she murders her first interviewee, a trashy psychotic hooker named Bunny, and makes the killing look like the work of an angry john. When another prostitute is found murdered, the media goes crazy and proclaims the murders are the work of a new serial killer: the Vice Stalker. Denver is overjoyed by the media hysteria and announces plans to make a reality-based film about the ""Vice Stalker murders."" Soon, however, someone begins stalking her and members of her cast and crew are being killed off. Will Denver survive this dangerous game and stop the other killer from exposing her secret?,",,$774(USA)(26 March 2000)(1 Screen),$954(USA)(2 April 2000),,,,,,Chris Morrissey Films,,"Los Angeles, California, USA",,The Future is Female,"B Movie , Cult"

The mode of transport of the women slaves, their miserable existence, forced marriages, physical torture and callous attitudes of the governments towards the whole issue have been explicitly presented in the film. The director has taken pains to trace the tale of horror from the crime's den - Dhaka - and how the women are bought and brought all the way to Delhi or Karachi. It contains views and observations of a number of Bengali and Nepalese social workers as well who, apart from acknowledging the problem, sound desperate for governments' co-operation in ridding the society of this evil business.,",,,,"Canadian International Development Agency, Films d'Art",,,,,,From Home to Hell,,,,
